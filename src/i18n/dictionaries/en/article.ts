In human life, the need for information is a very important thing. In the past, people sought information 
by reading newspapers, books, through word of mouth, or by witnessing events directly. 
But today, in the era of modernization, people can easily obtain information using 
<b>Digital Information Technology (Digital IT)</b>.
</p>

<p>
According to Wikipedia, Information Technology (IT) is a general term for any technology that helps humans 
in creating, modifying, storing, communicating, and disseminating information.
</p>

<p>
Thus, digital information technology is the result of digitizing the information processing process, 
making various human activities easier.
</p>

<p>
According to Haag et al. (2000), information technology is divided into six groups:
</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>1. Input Technology <i>(Input Technology)</i></b><br/>
  Hardware technology used to digitize data into the computer system. Examples include keyboards and mice.</li>

  <li><b>2. Output Technology <i>(Output Technology)</i></b><br/>
  Technology used to visualize or make physical representations of processed information. 
  Examples include monitors and printers.</li>

  <li><b>3. Software Technology <i>(Software)</i></b><br/>
  Software is an application program used to perform various tasks. 
  Examples include Microsoft Word for creating documents, or Adobe Premiere for editing videos.</li>

  <li><b>4. Storage Technology <i>(Storage Technology)</i></b><br/>
  Media used to store data and information. Hardware storage (e.g., flash drives, memory cards) is accessed offline, 
  while software-based storage (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) is accessed online.</li>

  <li><b>5. Telecommunication Technology <i>(Telecommunication Technology)</i></b><br/>
  Technology related to long-distance communication, enabling people to send and receive information remotely.</li>

  <li><b>6. Processing Machine or known as <i>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</i></b><br/>
  The CPU can be regarded as the heart of the entire computer system because it executes commands 
  that form computer programs.</li>
</ol>

<p>
It can be concluded that without the rapid development of information technology as we know it today, 
we would not be able to experience the convenience of daily activities. 
We wouldnâ€™t even be able to enjoy streaming movies or music as entertainment when bored.
</p>

<p>
As time goes by, these technologies continue to evolve. Many parties keep innovating to support human life 
for the better. Similarly, PT Aru Raharja continues to innovate in the field of Digital IT,
